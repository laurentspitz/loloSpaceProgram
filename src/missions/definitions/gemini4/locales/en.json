            "description": "Ed White became the first American to walk in space on June 3, 1965. Using a handheld nitrogen gun for propulsion, he floated outside for 23 minutes. When ordered to return, he replied 'This is the saddest moment of my life.' White would later perish in the Apollo 1 fire."
