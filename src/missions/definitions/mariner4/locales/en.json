            "description": "On July 15, 1965, Mariner 4 performed the first successful flyby of Mars, returning 22 close-up photos. The images revealed a cratered, Moon-like surface—shattering hopes of canals or vegetation. Mars was more desolate than expected, but the mission proved interplanetary exploration was possible.",
