            "description": "Neil Armstrong and David Scott achieved the first docking of two spacecraft on March 16, 1966, connecting with an Agena target vehicle. When a stuck thruster sent them into a dangerous spin, Armstrong coolly used reentry thrusters to regain control. This presaged his calm under pressure on Apollo 11.",
