            "description": "The first space station was launched on April 19, 1971. Though the first crew couldn't enter due to a docking hatch problem, the second crew (Soyuz 11) spent 23 days aboard. Tragically, they died during reentry due to a valve failure. Their sacrifice led to mandatory pressure suits during launch and landing.",
