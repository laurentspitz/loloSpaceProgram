            "description": "In October 1959, Luna 3 flew around the Moon and photographed its far side for the first time in history. The images, developed onboard and transmitted back to Earth, revealed a surprisingly different terrain—mostly highlands with few 'seas'. Features were named after Soviet pioneers."
